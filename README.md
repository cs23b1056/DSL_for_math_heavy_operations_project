# MathScript → NumPy Compiler (in C)

### 📘 Overview
A small compiler that translates a mathematical DSL (MathScript) into executable Python code using NumPy and Matplotlib.

### ⚙️ Features
- Vector and matrix declaration
- Dot product (`dot(a, b)`)
- Matrix multiplication (`A @ B`)
- Plotting support (`plot sin(x) from -3.14 to 3.14`)
- Semantic checking for:
  - Variable re-declaration
  - Type mismatches
  - Vector/matrix dimension mismatches
